I'm a passionate and results-driven Software Engineer based in Atlanta, USA. With a Master's in Computer Science and over two years of experience, I specialize in Java backend development and building robust, scalable technical solutions. I have a strong interest in applying LLMs to create autonomous AI systems and process automation tools.

ðŸš€ A Little More About Me...
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building multi-agent workflows and autonomous process automation tools using LangChain.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently diving deeper into agentic AI systems and novel applications of Large Language Models.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open-source projects involving Java, Spring Boot, or Machine Learning.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Java, Spring Boot, RESTful APIs, Python, and building with LLMs.
